### Repository Description:
This repository contains a few projects that I completed while at Whitworth University. The ones posted here are not perfect, but I believe they demonstrate my coding abilities and skills. The longest I spent on any one of these projects was at most four weeks.

## Folders:
For each of the following folders, there is more specific and in-depth documentation in each of the projects.
- __Course_Scheduler__
    - Description: Folder containing the final project for Advance Algorithms Design and Analysis Class. This project used a graph coloring algorithm to determine  a university department schedule considering professor availability, courses needed, and implicit and explicit constraints.
    - Semester: Fall 2022
    - Co-authors: Jorjei Ngoche and Aaron Borjas
- __Personal_Finance_App__
    - Description: Folder containing the final project for my Database Managment course. The focus of this project was to create some sort of program that utilized embedded SQL and a database. We utilized the Whitworth hosted database and created a simple finance application. This was my first project that also used a user interface which was exciting. After gaining more experience and knowledge, I most likely would have completed this project a lot differently, however at the time I was proud of what we accomplished in approximately three weeks.
    - Semester: Fall 2021
    - My main contributions: Embedded SQL, User interface, documentation and code comments.
